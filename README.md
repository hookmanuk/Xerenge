# Xerenge

Bringing Burnout Revenge (Xbox 360, retail) up as a native binary: the game's
PowerPC code is recompiled to C++ ahead of time and linked into an executable,
with the console's hardware and operating system emulated around it. There is
no CPU interpreter and no JIT.

**Supported release:** Burnout Revenge (Europe) only - this build is compatible
with the European ISO alone. Other dumps (the USA release, the beta, other
regions) are not supported.

## VR (0.4.9-vr-0.3)

This build plays Burnout Revenge in a VR headset through OpenXR (tested with
SteamVR). Head tracking, stereo 3D, the HUD on its own panel and the car
markers at their cars' depth all work in races, menus and replays.

### What's new in 0.4.9-vr-0.3 (since 0.4.9-vr-0.2)

- **Fire, smoke and dust.** The game's particles now show, at their right size
  and brightness. Smoke, glass and debris sit at their proper depth in each eye.
- **Explosions and burning wrecks.** The flames are visible and in the right
  place, instead of appearing for a moment and vanishing.
- **Sparks stay in the world.** The orange sparks from a crash no longer move
  with your head: turn your head and they stay at the wreck.
- **The TARGET label** sits above its car instead of floating in the HUD.
- **Crash camera.** The crash camera no longer judders with old frames in the
  headset: every frame now has its own head pose.
- **Crash events.** The fly-over before car select and the first moment of a
  race are no longer dark. The crash events' car has no glass in your way in the
  cockpit view, and the cockpit has its seat from its first frame, without a
  white and black frame at the GO.

### What's new in 0.4.9-vr-0.2 (since 0.4.9-vr-0.1)

- **Cockpit view.** A new view from the driver's seat, added to the game's own
  list of race views: **Y** goes round the bumper view, the cockpit and the
  chase view (see *Cockpit view* below). The view is fixed to the car, the
  windows are clear, the roof and pillars are no longer cut away close to your
  eyes, and the steering wheel turns with your steering.
- **Seat position.** The arrow keys move the view left, right, up and down, and
  **Ctrl+Up/Down** forward and back. The chase view and each car's cockpit keep
  their own position, and five cars come with their cockpit seat already set.
- **The cockpit comes in at the GO.** In races with a 3-2-1 countdown and in
  events that only have a GO (Crash events), whatever you press during the
  countdown. It stays on over jumps and hard hits against walls, and the game's
  own crash and takedown cameras still take over.
- **Crash events run at full frame rate.** The headset's frame rate no longer
  drops during crashes (it fell to about 50 FPS at 72 Hz), so head turns stay
  smooth, and the traffic and car parts move smoothly instead of juddering.
- **Fixes:** far signs no longer flicker against their boards; the race markers
  show, steady, in the cockpit view; the results screen after a race keeps its
  panels and text on the HUD instead of grey boxes stuck to your view.
- **The European release only.** This build supports the European disc image
  only; the USA release is not supported.

- **Starting it:** the installer adds a **Burnout Revenge VR** shortcut beside
  the normal one. Start your headset's OpenXR runtime (SteamVR) first.
- **Recentring:** press **Back** on the pad (or F8) to recentre the view.
- **Seat position:** the arrow keys move the view left, right, up and down,
  and **Ctrl+Up/Down** forward and back, up to 8 m (into the car from the
  chase camera; 1 m a second forward and back, 25 cm a second the others,
  while the game's window has the focus). It is kept in xerenge.conf as `vr_offset`.
- **Settings:** changing the resolution and the other VR options is done in
  the game, under **Driver Details > Graphics**: VR EYE SIZE (the per-eye
  resolution, 2560x2160 by default, up to 7680x5760), VR FRAME CAP and
  VR CAMERA SHAKE (Off, Light, Medium, Full; Light by default), BLOOM (Off,
  Light, Medium, Full; in VR its own setting, Light when the installer's bloom
  is on), sharpening and blur. Camera shake, sharpening, bloom and
  blur can also be changed from the race's pause menu, and take effect at once. The window options (KEEP 16:9, RENDER
  RESOLUTION, ANTI-ALIASING) do not apply in VR and are hidden there.
- **Disc:** this release carries the game built for the European disc only.

### Cockpit view

The cockpit view has been added to the game's list of race views. In a race,
press **Y** (the game's change-view button) to go round them: the low bumper
view, the cockpit, then the chase view. In the cockpit you sit in the driver's
seat: the view is fixed to the car, its windows are clear and the steering wheel
turns as you steer. The countdown and the game's own shots (takedowns, crashes)
keep the game's camera. **C** (the game's window focused) also switches between
the cockpit and the chase view.

**Positioning:** the **arrow keys** move your seat left, right, up and down, and
**Ctrl+Up/Down** move it forward and back (depth). Each car keeps its own cockpit
seat (`vr_cockpit_offset_<car>` in xerenge.conf), and the chase view keeps its own
(`vr_offset`).

**Building the VR version.** The VR support also needs the `vr` branch of
three forked dependencies, which `scripts/setup-sdk.sh` and
`scripts/setup-deps.sh` fetch on their own:

| Dependency | Fork and branch | What the VR branch adds |
| --- | --- | --- |
| SDK | [hookmanuk/rexglue-xerenge](https://github.com/hookmanuk/rexglue-xerenge/tree/vr), `vr` | the OpenXR layer: head tracking, multiview stereo, frame pacing, per-eye sharpening, recentring, drawing between logic steps |
| plume | [hookmanuk/plume-xerenge](https://github.com/hookmanuk/plume-xerenge/tree/vr), `vr` | multiview (both eyes in one pass), the hooks that share plume's Vulkan device with OpenXR |
| XenosRecomp | [hookmanuk/XenosRecomp-xerenge](https://github.com/hookmanuk/XenosRecomp-xerenge/tree/vr), `vr` | the stereo shader variants, the bloom strength in the composite |

They are forks of the dependencies upstream Xerenge uses (shipa-2's), so the
SDK, plume and XenosRecomp changes can be shared by other VR ports. The SDK is
built with Vulkan on (`-DREXGLUE_USE_VULKAN=ON`), and `scripts/build.sh` also
makes the stereo shader caches and, on Windows, puts the Khronos OpenXR loader
(`openxr_loader.dll`, 1.1.63) beside the game.

## Getting it running

You need a dump of the retail European release - the image hashing to
`34c1bd4d549c2c53f29d814fa5e5d1c04c533c5ca0c39e57b6c2538f44ff59b4` - and a
machine with Vulkan. Only the European ISO is compatible; SETUP.md has the
detail.

**With the installer.** `Burnout_Revenge_Installer-x86_64.AppImage` asks for the
disc image, the install directory and three settings (bloom, motion blur, and
which renderer), then does everything else itself: fetches this repository and
its dependencies from GitHub, checks and extracts the image, builds the SDK and
the title, translates the shaders, and creates a desktop shortcut and an
applications menu entry. Nothing from the game is downloaded - it is all made
from your disc, on your machine. The settings land in `xerenge.conf` in the
install directory and are read at every start, so they can be changed there
later - or in the game, under Driver Details > Settings (GRAPHICS, HACKS, DEBUG). To build the AppImage yourself: `rexglue/installer/make-appimage.sh`
(needs Qt 6, linuxdeploy and linuxdeploy-plugin-qt). The installer installs the
game for the European disc as `bin/burnout`.

**By hand.**

```
./scripts/bootstrap.sh /path/to/burnout-revenge.iso
cd rexglue && ./run.sh
```

The same works on a Mac with Apple silicon, and there is an installer app for
it too; SETUP.md has what it needs. Intel Macs are not supported.

That verifies the image, extracts it, builds the SDK and builds the title.
[`SETUP.md`](SETUP.md) covers the steps separately, what each one does, and what
to do when something goes wrong. The scripts are:

| | |
|---|---|
| `scripts/check-prerequisites.sh` | says what is missing before a build can fail halfway |
| `scripts/extract-image` | reads the disc image directly; XDVDFS, which ordinary tools do not open (built by `scripts/build-tools.sh`) |
| `scripts/setup-sdk.sh` | fetches and builds the recompiler and system layer |
| `scripts/setup-deps.sh` | fetches plume and XenosRecomp (our forks) and builds the shader translator |
| `scripts/build.sh` | points the manifest at your game directory, generates the code, translates the shaders and builds |
| `scripts/bootstrap.sh` | all of the above, in order |
| `scripts/inspect-capture.sh` | reads a RenderDoc capture offline: passes, the draw behind a given pixel, full state, textures |
| `rexglue/run.sh` | runs it, with the flags that are not optional and a log per run |
| `rexglue/installer/` | the Qt 6 installer and the script that packs it into an AppImage |

### Shaders

The title's shaders are its own code, so none are kept here: the build
translates them from your copy of the game. Most are found by scanning the
executable. The rest the title assembles while it runs - a shader from the
executable, or from a `graphics/*.obj` file on the disc, with a few
vertex-fetch instructions patched to match the vertex layout. Those are rebuilt
from the disc by the recipe in `rexglue/tools/runtime_shaders.recipe`, which
holds only hashes and patch masks, and each result is checked against its hash.
So every shader is there from the first frame, without running the game once to
collect them. `rexglue/tools/make_runtime_shader_recipe` (built by
`scripts/build-tools.sh`) refreshes the recipe from the shaders a run dumps
(`XERENGE_DUMP_UCODE=1`).

## Plume

Burnout Revenge draws through **plume**, this project's own GPU plugin
([`rexglue/src/plume_renderer/`](rexglue/src/plume_renderer/), the default
everywhere `./run.sh` runs it), on top of
[ReXGlue](https://github.com/rexglue/rexglue-sdk) through our fork
[rexglue-xerenge](https://github.com/shipa-2/rexglue-xerenge). The project
itself - manifest, function boundaries, app skeleton, build glue - is in
[`rexglue/`](rexglue/), with the detail in
[`rexglue/README.md`](rexglue/README.md).

Instead of emulating the Xenos command processor, plume takes the title's
Direct3D calls directly and draws with them. That one difference is where
most of what makes this build solid and fast comes from:

* **No GPU state caches to keep correct.** A command-processor emulator needs
  a texture cache for every Xenos format, an EDRAM render-target cache, and a
  shader cache kept in step with whatever the title binds. Drawing from the
  D3D calls directly needs none of that - the host GPU driver already does it.
* **Shaders are translated ahead of time**, not recompiled at runtime, so
  there is no JIT warm-up and no stutter the first time the title hits a new
  one.
* **Render targets are real host textures**, read back directly rather than
  reconstructed from an emulated EDRAM layout.
* **The frame's CPU work is spread out** - texture checks, vertex unpacking -
  over up to eight worker threads, instead of one emulation thread carrying
  all of it.
* **It runs everywhere Vulkan does**, from a desktop GPU down to a phone's,
  without a software GPU emulator in the way.

A second GPU plugin, **xenos** (`./run.sh --xenos`, the installer's "xenia
render") - ReXGlue's port of Xenia's GPU emulation, with shader translation at
runtime - is kept as the reference for when plume draws something
differently, and as how the project's earlier line, `legacy`
([`XerengeRuntime/`](XerengeRuntime/) on
[XenonRecomp-xerenge](https://github.com/shipa-2/XenonRecomp-xerenge) and
[XenosRecomp-xerenge](https://github.com/shipa-2/XenosRecomp-xerenge), frozen
but still buildable), proved that an early colour defect was in the recompiler
and not the graphics pipeline, before the move to ReXGlue.

## Where it stands

The title is fully playable on both supported releases: it boots, reaches the
title screen, loads a save, runs through car select, and races render at
60 fps. The audio is complete - engine sounds, crashes, the interface and the
licensed soundtrack - and the intro videos play. The frontend, the videos and
the 3D world are colour-correct. It runs on Linux, Windows, Android (phones
with a Vulkan 1.0+ GPU) and macOS (Apple silicon).

All of it besides the disc image and the install path is a setting, not a
patch: the installer and `xerenge.conf` cover them, and most are reachable
from the running game too, under Driver Details > Settings (GRAPHICS, HACKS,
DEBUG) - changing one there and confirming it offers a restart that applies
it at once, without reinstalling.

The game runs at its own pace, not the renderer's. Its logic steps on a fixed
timer, and each frame is held to the console's 60 Hz vblank by default - 30
fps in Crash mode, as on the console. A 30 fps lock (two logic steps a frame,
everywhere) and frame generation (a frame drawn between each two of the
game's, for 90-120 Hz screens, including through Crash mode's lock) are both
shipped settings, off by default; `XERENGE_UNLOCK_FPS=1` instead lifts the cap
entirely and lets the logic follow the wall clock.

Textures are loaded with their full mip chains from the title's memory, and
sampled with the filtering and anisotropy the title asks for; on a GPU with no
hardware texture compression (common on phones), they are re-encoded to ETC2
once and cached, rather than decompressed every time.

The frame can be anti-aliased and sharpened as it is presented
(`plume_postfx.cpp`): FXAA, after NVIDIA's FXAA 3.11, or SMAA 1x, and AMD's
FidelityFX CAS, full-screen passes from the scene target through intermediate
targets, then the usual copy onto the window. SMAA is the reference
implementation of Jimenez, Echevarria, Masia, Navarro and Gutierrez (MIT
licence, `rexglue/thirdparty/smaa`) at its HIGH preset, with edges found from
luma: three passes - edges, blending weights from its two lookup tables, the
blend - where FXAA is one. All are off by default - the console had none of
them, and with them off nothing is recorded. Colour grade, brightness and
shadow lift are adjustable too, live, over the console's own look. The
settings are live (read once a frame); `XERENGE_AA` and `XERENGE_SHARPEN` set
where they start.

The frame is drawn at the window's resolution rather than the console's 720p,
and the copies of it the post-processing reads are kept at that size. A pass
that shrinks a copy further - the bloom's first step, 1280x720 into 320x180 -
samples it with offsets made for 720p, and at a higher resolution it would
catch a different few pixels of each block every frame: small highlights
flickered through the glare and the whole picture shimmered. Such a copy is
filtered down to its guest size first (halved while a half covers it, then
the last step), at any window size and shape.

**Online.** `ealobby`, a lobby server standing in for EA's, is already
pointed at by default (a self-hosted one), so online play works without
running anything yourself; a self-hosted server also carries the Locker
(Burnout Clips: saving, sharing and recommending replays, the top 20 and
recent-players rankings) and serves the game's News screen the latest
release's notes. Running your own `ealobby` instead is one flag away for a
LAN or a server of your own.

**Achievements** are read from the title's own data and shown as it earns
them - a notice drawn over the game without pausing it, and the full list
with their descriptions under Player File > Stats.

Open:

* The Wayland surface extension is offered by the loader but never enabled, so
  runs go through X11.
* plume: a black frame still flashes very occasionally, and a texture
  sometimes shows wrong for half a second during a race.

## What is not here

Game images, decrypted data, extracted assets, build directories and generated
recompiler output are deliberately excluded, here and in the forks. The ReXGlue
SDK is a separate checkout rather than vendored.

## Mods

Translations into languages the game was never released in - with fonts of
their own, drawn to look like the game's - and your own music in place of EA
Trax: [`MODDING.md`](MODDING.md) has how.

## Reporting a problem

Read [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) first: a report needs the log, the
version, the hardware and the steps to reproduce it.

## Licence

Xerenge's own code is under the GNU General Public License, version 3 or later
([LICENSE](LICENSE)). The ReXGlue SDK and the third-party code under
`rexglue/thirdparty` keep their own licences. Burnout Revenge itself is not
covered: it is EA's and Criterion's, and you need your own disc to play.
